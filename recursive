factorial(n)

factorial(5) = 120 

Understanding the Recursive Function
Base Case (n == 0 or n == 1)
When n reaches 0 or 1, the recursion stops and returns 1.
This is necessary to prevent infinite recursion.

Recursive Case (n > 1)
The function calls itself with the argument n-1, effectively reducing the problem size by one.

Step 1: 
    factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)

Step 2:
    factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)

Step 3:
    factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2)

Step 4:
    factorial(2) = 2 * factorial(1)

Step 5:
    factorial(1) = 1

Step 6:
    factorial(2) = 2 * 1 = 2

Step 7:
    factorial(3) = 3 * 2 = 6

Step 8:
    factorial(4) = 4 * 6 = 24

Step 9: 
    factorial(5) = 5 * 24 = 120

The recursion stops when n reaches 1, and the final result is 120.
